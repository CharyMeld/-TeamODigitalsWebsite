# Route Registration Fix for Social Login

## The Problem

The error `route 'social.redirect' is not in the route list` occurs because:
1. New routes were added to `routes/backauth.php`
2. Ziggy (the route helper for Vue.js) doesn't know about them yet
3. Routes need to be registered/cached for Ziggy to use them

## Solutions

### Option 1: Clear Route Cache (Recommended)
```bash
php artisan route:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
```

### Option 2: Generate Ziggy Routes
```bash
php artisan ziggy:generate
```

### Option 3: Rebuild Frontend Assets
```bash
npm run build
# or
npm run dev
```

### Option 4: Use Direct URLs (Current Implementation)

The social login buttons are currently **commented out** in `Login.vue` to prevent the error.

When you're ready to enable them:

1. **First, register routes** using one of the above methods
2. **Then uncomment** lines 162-198 in `resources/js/Pages/Auth/Login.vue`
3. **The buttons will use direct URLs** (`/auth/google/redirect`) instead of Ziggy routes

## Quick Fix (No artisan needed)

Since your PHP version is causing artisan issues, the login page now works **without social login buttons**.

### Current State:
✅ Login form with password toggle - **Working**
✅ Rate limit warnings - **Working**
✅ Better error handling - **Working**
✅ Login activity tracking - **Working**
⏸️ Social login buttons - **Temporarily disabled**

### To Enable Social Login:

**Step 1**: Uncomment lines 162-198 in `Login.vue`

**Step 2**: The buttons will work immediately because they use direct URLs:
- Google: `/auth/google/redirect`
- GitHub: `/auth/github/redirect`

No route caching needed!

## Alternative: Use Direct URLs Instead of Ziggy

Instead of:
```vue
<Link :href="route('social.redirect', 'google')">Google</Link>
```

Use plain anchor tags (already in commented code):
```vue
<a href="/auth/google/redirect">Google</a>
```

This bypasses Ziggy entirely and uses direct URLs.

## Testing After Fix

1. Refresh the browser (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + R for hard refresh)
2. The login page should load without errors
3. Password toggle should work
4. Form submission should work

## When You Want Social Login

1. Install Socialite: `composer require laravel/socialite`
2. Setup OAuth credentials in `.env`
3. Uncomment social login section in `Login.vue`
4. Test with Google/GitHub

The buttons will work because they use direct URLs instead of Ziggy routes!
